# Nintendo DS Game Engine

A very basic Game Engine for the NDS originally created for a school project.

### Features:
- SceneGraph class and renderer.
- Textured and Colored Meshes.
- Basic Physics (No collision.)
- Camera class including movement.

## Setup
1. Copy this folder (or symbolic link) to the path of devkitPro under 'C:/devkitPro/NDS-Game-Engine'. This ensures that the library can be found when compiling / modifying code.
2. Run 'make'. Assuming that the library is installed and working, the project should compile.
3. After the 'make' command is finished, you should have a '.nds' file in the root directory of the project.
4. Open the '.nds' file in an emulator or a homebrewed NDS device. You should be good to go! :)
